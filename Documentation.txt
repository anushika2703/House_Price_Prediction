Housing Price Prediction — Project Documentation

#1. Introduction

This project aims to build a Machine Learning model that predicts housing prices in India. The dataset contains real-estate listing information such as carpet area, floor details, transaction type, location, and price indicators.

The main focus is on:

* Cleaning messy real-estate data
* Extracting numerical information from text
* Encoding categorical variables
* Training and evaluating a regression model


#2. Dataset Description 

The dataset contains 21 columns, including:

- Key Features  

1. Amount(in rupees) : Total cost of the flat (e.g.,     “42 Lac”, “1.40 Cr”)         
2. Price (in rupees) : Price per sq ft (numeric)                                  
3. Carpet Area : Carpet area in sq.ft formatted as “500 sqft”                
4. Floor : Shows current floor and total floors (e.g., “10 out of 11”) |
5. Status : Ready to Move / Under Construction                          6. Transaction : Resale / New Property                                       7. location : Areas within Thane                                          8. Facing, Overlooking : Categorical attributes                                      9. Ownership : Freehold, Co-operative, etc.                                

- Target Variable

The prediction target is:

Amount(in rupees) (Converted to numeric)

#3. Data Preprocessing

- 3.1 Convert Price Values (“Lac”, “Cr”) into Numeric

Examples:

* 42 Lac → 4,200,000
* 1.4 Cr → 14,000,000

A custom function was used to perform this conversion.

- 3.2 Extract Carpet Area

Carpet area text is cleaned:
"500 sqft" → 500

- 3.3 Extract Floor Information

Split floor values into:

* Floor Number
* Total Floors

Example:
"10 out of 11" → Floor Number = 10, Total Floors = 11

- 3.4 Handle Missing Values

* Numeric columns → median filled
* Categorical columns → label encoded after converting to string

- 3.5 Drop High-Text Columns

Columns like Title, Description, Society, Dimensions, Plot Area were removed as they require NLP for proper processing.

#4. Model Development  

- 4.1 Feature Matrix

`X` contains all cleaned and encoded columns.

- 4.2 Target Variable

`y = Amount(in rupees)` (actual property price)

- 4.3 Model Used

Random Forest Regressor

* Handles non-linear relationships
* Works well with categorical encodings
* Robust with missing and noisy data

- 4.4 Train-Test Split

test_size = 0.2  
random_state = 42

#5. Model Evaluation

Metrics used:

* RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) — lower is better
* R² Score — closer to 1.0 is better

After training, the model is evaluated on unseen test data.

Predictions are generated using:

- python
- model.predict(X_test.iloc[0:1])
- Outputs are realistic property prices (Lacs/Crores).

#6. Prediction Example

Input features (sample from test set):
python
sample = X_test.iloc[0:1]
prediction = model.predict(sample)
Example output:
array([13800000.])   # ₹1.38 Cr

#7. Requirements

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn

#8. Running the Project (Google Colab)

1. Upload dataset
2. Install requirements
3. Run notebook:
   * Load Data
   * Clean & Transform
   * Train Model
   * Predict

#9. Conclusion

This project successfully:

* Cleaned and transformed a complex real-estate dataset
* Extracted useful numerical features
* Applied label encoding on categorical attributes
* Trained a Random Forest Regressor
* Achieved realistic price predictions for Thane properties
